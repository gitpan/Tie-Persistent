Tie::Persistent v1.00
=====================

The Persistent package makes working with persistent data real
easy by using the C<tie> interface.

It works by storing data contained in a variable into a file (not
unlike a database). The primary advantage is speed, as the whole
datastructure is kept in memory (which is also a limitation), and, of
course, that you can use arbitrary data structures inside the variable
(unlike DB_File).

To install, either use the excellent CPAN module or do the usual

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Note that Tie::Persistent uses Data::Dumper and Storable, so
you should make sure that these are available.  As Data::Dumper
comes with the base perl package and Storable is also on its way
there, this shouldn't be a problem in the future.  Actually
Storable isn't needed and if it's not there, a warning is issued,
but the module will work without it.

Changes:
--------

* fixed a bug with numbered backupfiles

* Storable is now optional, a warning is issued if '-w' is active.

* removed Sys::Hostname due to portability problems

* added a sync() method and autosyncing (thanks to Benjamin Liberman
  <beanjamman@yahoo.com> for that)

* fixed a bug with scalar refs and splice

I'm considering Tie::Persistent quite mature from now on (apart
from the experimental feature, for which I haven't received any
feedback).

Please feel free to send feedback and support requests.
